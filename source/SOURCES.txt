This file describes the source files included with the Harmattan font 
family. This information should be distributed along with the Harmattan
fonts and any derivative works.

These files are part of Harmattan font family (http://scripts.sil.org/Harmattan) 
and are Copyright (c) 2014-2015 SIL International (http://www.sil.org/),

details including an FAQ.

FontLab "*-designsource.vfb" file: The .vfb file is a FontLab file and 
contains all the glyph outline data for the font. Please note that it is not
possible to generate a font from this file that is identical to the final
version, as postprocessing is done on the font after generation from
FontLab.

"*.enc" file: This is a plain-text file that identifes the required glyph
order for this font. It can be used as a FontLab encoding file to sort
glyphs prior to exporting the font. There may be glyphs identified in this
file that are not present in the font, in which case those can simply
be ignored.

OpenType "*-designsource.otf" files: These are CFF-flavored OpenType fonts 
containing PostScript-style outlines. These are not intended as installable fonts, 
and we do not support that use. They are provided as a non-proprietary 
source of PostScript-style bézier outlines and can be opened by many font 
design programs, including FontForge.

TrueType "*-designsource.ttf" files: These are TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts
containing bezier-curve outlines. These can be compiled with the VOLT and
Graphite source code provided with this package to make functioning smart fonts,
though these will not be identical to the final version due to post-processing.

Anchor "*-anchors.xml" file: These XML files contain data on anchors
(attachment points) used in creating composite glyphs and OpenType/Graphite
code. This anchor data is present in the .vfb files, but this is a separate,
non-proprietary, text-based source for that information.

VOLT code: The code used to insert OpenType tables into the font is included in
a VOLT font format. See the README.txt file in the VOLT folder for details.

Graphite code: See the README.txt file in the Graphite folder for details.
